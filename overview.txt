    - AI
        - Encompasses all
        - Intelligent agent = rational agent, one acting to acheive one's goals, given one's beliefs
    - ML
        - Subset of AI
        - Computer performs task without using explicit instructions
        - Learns from data
            - Takes in examples and derives rules
        - Paradigms
            - Supervised learning
                - Model trained with labeled data
                - Data given to system where solution is annotated along with the data
            - Unsupervised learning
                - Model draws inferences from unstructured data 
                - Data is passed to system without telling the system the solution
            - Reinforcement learning
                - Agent takes actions in virtual environment and learns through rewards
        -Algorithms
            - Logistic regression
            - Linear regression
            - Random forest
            - K nearest neighbor
            - Support vector machines
            - Neural networks (NN)
                - Input layer is the first layer
                - Hidden layers process the information
                - Output layer gets the inferences
    - DL
        - Subset of ML
        - (Deep) neural networks
        - >1 hidden layers
        - Audio applications
            - Speech recognition
            - Voice-based emotion classification
            - Noise recognition
            - Muscal genre, instrusment, mood classification

    - Traditional ML vs DL
        - Traditional ML is more feature engineering
            - Ideal for simple problems
            - Extract features from the data
            - Those features are passed to the ML algorthim and then it figures out the rules
            - Small dataset
            - Less computationally intensive
        - DL is more end-to-end
            - Ideal for complex problems
            - Just pass in the row data directly to the ML algorithm
            - Changes the weights of the features on its own
            - Large dataset
            - Very resource intensive

    - Multilayer perceptron
    - Convolutional neural networks (CNN's)
    - Recurrent neural networks (RNN's)
    - Generative adversarial networks (GAN's)
