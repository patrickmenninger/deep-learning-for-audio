Biological neurons
    - Dendrites
        - Inputs, modules
        - Get signals from other neurons and input to cell body
    - Cell body
        - Operatinal center of neuron
        - does operation on signals
    - Synaptic termianls
        - Connected to other neurons

Artifical neuron
    - Input -> Sum -> Activation -> Output
    - Input (x1, x2, ...)
    - Weights for each input (dendrites)
    - Sum and activation (cell body)
        - SUM: h (net input) = sum of all inputs times their weights (dot product)
        - ACTIVATION: y = f(h) = activation function of the sum of all inputs times their weights
            - Sigmond function is the activation function one used in this demo
                - 1/(1 + (e^-x))
                - Bounded between 0 and 1
                - Smooth, with x = 0 at y = 0.5
    - Output
Code
    - function definition : def ____(): 
    - zip function: enables to pack multiple lists into one index
        - [a, b, c] | [x, y, z]
        - zip(1, 2) = [(a, x), (b, y), (c, z)]
